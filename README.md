# shortest_path_algo
find shortest path between vertices

Design, implement, and test a solution for the problem of finding a shortest path between two vertices s
and t of a weighted graph G=<V, E>.

The input file will have this format:

1-> number of vertices in G

2-> adjacency matrix, one row of the matrix in each line; consecutive values in a row will be
separated by a space

3-> s and t, separated by a space
