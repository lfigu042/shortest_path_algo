# shortest_path_algo
find shortest path between vertices

Design, implement, and test a solution for the problem of finding a shortest path between two vertices s
and t of a weighted graph G=<V, E>.

The input file will have this format:
• number of vertices in G
• adjacency matrix, one row of the matrix in each line; consecutive values in a row will be
separated by a space
• s and t, separated by a space
